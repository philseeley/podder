NAME
       podder - Command line utility for downloading podcasts

SYNOPSIS
       podder [OPTIONS] +c config-file [[OPTIONS] +c config-file] ...

DESCRIPTION
       config-files  are processed in the order specified. Options can be turned on and off for each config file. Options stay in effect for all following
       config-files.  All the podcasts will be downloaded relative to the location of each config-file, one sub-directory is created per feed.  Locking is
       performed to stop a config-file from being processed multiple times.

       The  <title>s  in the feeds are used to name the feed directories and the downloaded files unless overridden with the +d or +f options.  A log file
       config-file.log is created to record downloaded podcasts.

       Specifying config-file as "-" will read the list of feeds from standard input. In this case all the feed directories will be  created  relative  to
       the current working directory and the log file will be "-.log".

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       The config-file contains one line per feed of the form:

              url [OPTIONS]

       All OPTIONS are applied before the feed is processed and only apply to the url and not any following ones.

OPTIONS
       Options can be turned on (+) and off (-). Note that this differs from normal option processing, but makes more sense.

       All  options are valid on the command line and for each feed. Specifying {+|-}c config-file in the per-feed options is also valid, but any directo‚Äê
       ries will be relative to the including config-file.

       {+|-}c config-file
              process config file config-file.

       +C NUM|-C
              catch up. Only downloads the first NUM podcasts.  Useful if it's the first time you're downloading a feed and only want to  start  with  the
              most recent episodes. Specify 0 to avoid all downloads.

       +d DIR|-d
              use DIR as the directory to store the feed in, rather then using the feed's <title>.

       {+|-}D create a date directory at the top level.  A directory of the form yyyy-mm-dd is created above the feed directories.

       {+|-}f use the filenames of the podcasts rather than their <title>s.

       {+|-}F store just the filenames of the podcasts in the log file, rather than the complete URL. This is useful for feeds that move hosts.

       {+|-}q quiet output. Useful in crontabs.

       {+|-}t test what would be downloaded. No actual downloads are performed and no log entries are written.

       {+|-}v verbose output. Enables output from wget.

       +l LIMIT|-l
              limits  the  download speed to LIMIT bytes per second. LIMIT may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the k suffix, or megabytes with the m
              suffix.

       {+|-}p write .m3u playlist files. On by default.

       {+|-}a write .m3u playlist files alphabetically. By default the files are written in modification time order, which wget attempts to take from  the
              source file.

       {+|-}n write .m3u playlist files using the directory name as the playlist name. By default the files are called podder.m3u.

EXAMPLES
       To download all podcasts to a single dated directory:

              podder +D +d . +c config-file

       To download all podcasts in config-0 to a single dated directory and all podcasts in config-1 as normal:

              podder +D +d . +c config-0 -D -d +c config-1

       The following config-file will just store the podcast's filename in the log file for http://lugradio.org/episodes.rss:

              http://lugradio.org/episodes.rss +F
              http://thelinuxlink.net/tllts/tllts.rss

       To download a random set of feeds each day (random_feed_gen is left as an exercise for the reader):

              random_feed_gen | podder +D +d . +c -

FEATURES
       The complete flexibility in option specifications was more interesting to write, rather than being strictly necessary.
